## Description
This application is a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the Progressive Web Application criteria. It also features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. This combining these technologies and techniques means the application will also function offline.
